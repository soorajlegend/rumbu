### The Problem

The problem that Rumbu aims to address is the complex interplay of challenges faced by farmers, especially those in conflict zones and regions with limited infrastructure. These challenges include inadequate storage facilities, restricted market access, post-harvest losses, and overall food insecurity. Farmers often struggle to preserve the quality and quantity of their produce due to a lack of modern storage solutions, resulting in significant wastage. Additionally, in conflict-prone areas, the situation is exacerbated, leading to forced migration, loss of livelihoods, and critical food shortages.

This multifaceted problem touches on several dimensions – economic, social, and environmental. It affects the livelihoods of millions of farmers, contributes to food scarcity, drives up prices, and adds pressure to already strained communities. Furthermore, the issue is intricately linked to sustainability, as food waste contributes to environmental degradation, loss of resources, and increased carbon footprint.

The problem isn't just about the lack of storage or access – it's about the far-reaching consequences that reverberate through societies, economies, and ecosystems. Rumbu recognizes the urgency of this problem and endeavors to transform it into an opportunity for positive change. By leveraging technology, innovation, and a commitment to empowerment, Rumbu seeks to revolutionize food security and shape a more sustainable future for all.
